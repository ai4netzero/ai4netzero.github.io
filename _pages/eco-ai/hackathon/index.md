# ECO-AI Hackathon: AI-Driven Solutions for Carbon Capture and Storage

Join forces with your fellow researchers (PhD students & PDRAs) from across the UK to innovate and collaborate exploring AI for NetZero approaches. Over the course of a three days, you'll be challenged to work on unique problems related to carbon capture and storage (CCS), and its economics and policy implications. You will be provided with the tools, support, and data needed to write new codes and study current challenges in material discovery using AI, subsurface flow modelling using AI, and uncovering progress by abstract clustering of CCS patents using AI.

Participating researchers will receive informative workshops and mentorship from Heriot-Watt University (HWU) and Imperial College London (ICL) experts working within the ECO-AI project. 

# Event Details
Date: Wednesday 13 March – Friday 15 March 2024 <br>
Venue: Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK

## What to expect
This is a two-part event. You will be invited to attend an AI workshop in CCS and the ECO-AI project on 11 & 12 March. This will lead into the Hackathon (13- 15 March) where you will have the option to compete in one of three tracks: 
* Machine learning for encoding and decoding of molecules with the aim of designing a powerful decoder that produces valid structures.
* Machine learning for prediction of dissolution in porous media flow.
* Machine learning for clustering of CCS patents.

## Event Flow
1. Attend 2-day AI workshop on CCS.
1. Form teams and select challenge track.
1. Collaborate on solutions over 3-day hackathon.
1. Demo solutions to experts from industry and academia.


As a participant, you will have access to the required platforms and software **to perform the deep learning experiments during the Hackathon.**

<!-- # Event Highlights
Date & Time: 13th March - End of 15th March 2024 <br>
Venue: Heriot-Watt University
 -->

This Hackathon will allow you to collaborate with your peers from outside your own institution and to network with the workshop participants. At the end of the Hackathon your team will have the chance to demonstrate your work to data scientists within the ECO-AI project and industry experts attending the workshop.

**Food and beverages (brain fuel) will be provided during the event.**

# Who Should Attend
The workshop is ideal for PhD students and early career researchers interested in AI applications in environmental sciences, particularly those focusing on CCS technologies. It's an excellent opportunity for anyone eager to contribute to the global effort in reducing carbon emissions through innovative AI-driven solutions.
