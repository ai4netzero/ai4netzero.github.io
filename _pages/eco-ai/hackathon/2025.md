# ECO-AI Hackathon: Enabling Carbon Capture and Storage using AI
After the success of the ECO-AI Hackathon in March 2024, we’re excited to invite PhD students and PDRAs from across the UK to again join forces for three days of innovation and collaboration on AI for NetZero solutions. You’ll tackle unique challenges in carbon capture and storage and explore their economic and policy implications.

## Event Details
**Dates:** Wednesday 26 March – Friday 28 March 2025 <br>
**Location:** Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK <br>
**Venue:** Scott Suite, Edinburgh Business School

## Application
This in-person event will include informative workshops and mentorship led by experts from Heriot-Watt University and Imperial College London involved in the ECO-AI project. Successful applicants will receive £300 in funding toward travel and accommodation expenses. 

Application Deadline: **Monday 27 January 2025** (now closed)
<!-- [Apply Now](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/76943/submitter) -->

<!-- We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all participants. Please complete the [EDI form](https://forms.office.com/e/d8dUmWmNqA) as part of your application.  -->

## What to Expect
This is a two-parts event, including the ECO-AI project workshop (24-25 March), where you’ll attend presentations and panel discussions on using AI for CO₂ capture and storage. Following this, the Hackathon (26-28 March) will involve team-based work on one of three challenge tracks: 
* CO₂ Storage: Fast prediction of two phase flow in porous media using deep learning
* CO₂ Capture: Predicting properties of amine molecules for carbon capture using AI
* CCS policy and economics: LLM-Driven analysis of climate policies and SDG alignment

## Event Flow
1. Attend 2-day AI workshop on CCS
1. Form teams and select challenge track
1. Collaborate on solutions over 3-day hackathon
1. Demo solutions to experts from industry and academia

Participants will have access to all necessary platforms and software for deep learning experiments throughout the Hackathon. This is a unique opportunity to collaborate across institutions, network with participants, and showcase your work to data scientists and industry experts. 

*Food and beverages will be provided throughout the event* 


## Background & pre-reading
All participants are expected to possess basic knowledge of Python and some ML tools (e.g., Scikit-learn, PyTorch). For those who are not familiar with these tools, pre-reading on how to use basic Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch using the following resources is recommended:
1. [Enthought Numpy Tutorial - SciPyConf 2023](https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2023)
2. [University of Washington Machine Learning with Python Course](https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/machinelearning-py/)
3. [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
