# ECO-AI Workshop: AI-Driven Solutions for Carbon Capture and Storage

The ECO-AI project recently hosted an immersive two-day workshop dedicated to exploring groundbreaking AI solutions in the field of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This event, a key component of the ECO-AI project, aimed to address critical challenges in implementing large-scale CCS technologies. The event delved into innovative AI applications that enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of CCS processes.

## Event Details
**Date and Time:** <br>
Monday 11 March: 13:00 - 17:00 (lunch served from 12:00) <br>
Tuesday 12 March: 09:00 - 17:00 <br>
**Location:** Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK <br>
**Venue:** Scott Suite, Edinburgh Business School

## Engaging Sessions and Expert Panels
The workshop featured a diverse lineup of sessions led by renowned experts from the ECO-AI project team at Heriot-Watt University and Imperial College London, along with prominent academic and industry leaders. The workshop covered a wide range of topics including:
* AI materials discovery pipeline for energy-efficient CO2 capture.
* AI-solvers for modelling CO2 flow in geological storage formations.
* Modelling CO2 target progress and innovation trajectories in various industrial sectors.
* **Special Guest Speakers from other projects funded under the UKRI call on AI for NetZero research.**

## Collaboration and Learning
Participants networked with leading scientists and professionals in the field, engaged in thought-provoking discussions on AI’s role in achieving the UK’s NetZero targets, and gained insights from external speakers representing other UKRI-funded projects under the AI for NetZero funding calls.
