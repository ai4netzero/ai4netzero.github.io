I lead a research group of computational scientists with deep knowledge, in mathematical modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We actively push the research frontiers at the interface of scientific computing, machine learning, optimization and control of large scale computational models (e.g. fluid flow, hydrology, subsurface CO2 storage).
