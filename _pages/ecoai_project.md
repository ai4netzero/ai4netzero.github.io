## Enabling CO2 capture and storage using AI 

ECO-AI is a UKRI funded project (RC Grant reference: EP/Y006143/1) to address key barriers for large scale Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) implementation including: a) high energy demands of the capture process, b) high cost for predicting and monitoring CO2 plume migration, storage conformance and caprock integrity, and c) uncertainties in financing CCS projects and lack of understanding of the impact of regulatory and/or market interventions on achieving the UK NetZero targets. The project team aims to address these barriers by developing
- AI materials discovery pipeline for energy efficient CO2 capture
- AI-solvers for modelling CO2 flow in geological storage formations
- Modelling CO2 target progress coupled with innovation trajectories for each industrial sector

## Workpackages and tasks
- WP1: AI for scientific discovery and multiscale modelling (Pain, Elsheikh, Fang, Chada)
- WP2: AI-Enabled-CO2 Capture: Integrated Solvent and Process design (Cummings, McCabe, Adjiman, Jackson, Galindo)
- WP3: AI-enabled CO2 storage in deep geological formations (Singh, Menke, Busch, Doster, Elsheikh)
- WP4: Sectoral Targets for CO2 & Innovation Advantage (Dimitris, Chada)
- WP5: Dissemination, community building and public outreach (Elsheikh, Project team)

## National and global importance

CCS is widely considered as a game-changer in industrial decarbonisation with the potential of lowering annual CO2 emissions on the giga-tonne scale. General cost reduction by developing new liquid solvents for CO2 capture is essential for sustainability and reduction of net CO2 emissions. Similarly, cost reduction of geological CO2 storage and overall risk limitation will be key to define business, safety and acceptance cases. Progress in CCS delivery is expected to contribute ~20% of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. In ECO-AI, we will develop a radically different approach to AI-accelerated solvent discovery for carbon capture (and beyond) and the development and design of new engineering materials and/or biological molecules. Moreover, in ECO-AI we will make advancements in geological storage site selection by obtaining more realistic predictions of CO2 plume migration and possible leakage by predicting reservoir pressure changes.
