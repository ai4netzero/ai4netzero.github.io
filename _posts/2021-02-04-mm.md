In this post, I will details few minor changes/modifications to the amazing [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), code that power this Blog.

<!--  
- Remove the RSS block in the footer. Need to modify the last block of the file `\include\footer.html` to be  <br>
>"<div class="page__footer-copyright">&copy; {{ site.time | date: '%Y' }} {{ site.name | default: site.title }}. {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].powered_by | default: "Powered by" }}"
>"<a href="https://jekyllrb.com" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> &amp; <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/" rel="nofollow">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</div>"

If the file is missing (e.g. using a `remote_theme`), create a copy of that file locally from the github [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). -->
--- Create a `feature_rows` helper that resize (actually limit the size) of images in the splash layout (see the `team.md`) and the file `\include\footer.html`. This file is identical to the one in the github repository except for the line  

```
<div class="archive__item" style="width:80%">
```
