- Make sure you have `ssh` keys to allow for password-less login (see [DO guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2) for how to do that)
- Run the `vpn` agent if your server is behind a firewall
- On the server run the `jupyter` notebook in headless mode using a command  
```jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080```  
Resulting in something like  
```http://localhost:8080/?token=88495a69a74a90e62ada1388c4abc30606474df18131bf67```
Copy this command as you will need it later !!
- On the client side (your laptop), create an ssh tunnel using  
```ssh -N -L localhost:8080:localhost:8080 username@server_ip_address```
- Open Firefox (or any browser) on the client side (your laptop) and type  
```http://localhost:8080/?token=88495a69a74a90e62ada1388c4abc30606474df18131bf67```
using the same token you got from step above


Please Note that the choice of the ports on both sides doesn't have to be the same and the local port 8080 is arbitrary and the port 8080 on the server have to be open and listening/traffic is allowed through the vpn on that port. Also please note that this token will different every time you run the jupyter command. BTW, I usually use
```
nohup jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080 >> jupyer_key.log 2>&1 &
```
