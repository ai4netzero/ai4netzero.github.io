I lead the AI4NetZero research group at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Our team is at the forefront of exploring innovative solutions to address the NetZero challenge. We pioneer efficient engineering methods across a range of applications. Our unique approach combines scientific computing, machine learning, optimization, and control of large-scale computational models, such as fluid flow, hydrology, and subsurface CO2 storage, to tackle this pressing global challenge.
